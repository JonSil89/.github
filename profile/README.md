## Hi there 👋

# Gatehouse Infrastructure

**Policy-Driven Infrastructure**  
**Quality-Gated Change**  
**Governed Automation**

---

## What This Is

Gatehouse Infrastructure is an orchestration-first platform initiative focused on:

- Infrastructure Change Quality Gates  
- AI-assisted ITSM & Compliance automation  
- Lifecycle-controlled IoT & Edge environments  
- ISO 27001-aligned governance design  

This is not a script collection.  
This is governance implemented as code.

---

## Mission

Eliminate uncontrolled infrastructure change by embedding:

- Governance into pipelines  
- Compliance into automation  
- Risk evaluation into CI/CD  
- Lifecycle control into IoT  

Infrastructure should be structured.  
Change should be auditable.  
Automation should be policy-aware.

---

## Architecture Model

The platform is built around three core pillars.

---

### 1. Infrastructure Change Quality Gate

A DevSecOps control layer ensuring:

- Policy validation before deployment  
- Automated risk scoring  
- Auditable approval logic  
- Compliance-aware release flow  

Goal: Enable ISO-aligned change governance without slowing delivery.

---

### 2. AI-ITSM-Compliance Automation

AI-assisted orchestration connecting:

- ITSM workflows  
- Incident & change classification  
- Risk tagging  
- Compliance traceability  

Objective: Decision support within governance boundaries.

---

### 3. HAaaS – Home Automation as a Service

Lifecycle-managed IoT and edge infrastructure:

- Infrastructure-as-Code driven  
- Device lifecycle control (DLCM)  
- Secure configuration baselines  
- Managed update governance  

IoT should be treated as regulated infrastructure — not hobby automation.

## Governance Layers

Each repository contributes to one of these layers:

| Layer           | Purpose                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Policy         | Control definitions & governance logic   |
| Gate           | Automated validation & enforcement       |
| Orchestration  | Workflow coordination                    |
| Infrastructure | IaC & environment design                 |
| Lifecycle      | Device & asset state management          |

---

## Core Repositories

- `infrastructure-change-quality-gate`
- `AI-ITSM-Compliance-Auto`
- `HAaaS`
- `governance-templates`
- `iso27001-mapping-examples`

Each repository represents a modular capability within a unified orchestration model.

---

## Design Principles

- Governance by design  
- Automation before manual control chains  
- Policy-as-Code over documentation PDFs  
- Observable decision paths  
- Auditability as default  

---

## Target Environment

- Enterprise infrastructure  
- Public sector & regulated environments  
- Hybrid cloud  
- Edge & IoT ecosystems  
- DevSecOps pipelines  

---

## Strategic Direction

- Fully orchestrated compliance-aware pipelines  
- AI-assisted governance decision support  
- Modular policy engines  
- Scalable lifecycle-managed IoT platforms  

Long-term objective:  
Create a reusable governance-first infrastructure blueprint.
